-- LAB 2.7 Part 1 --


-- In this activity we are going to do some database maintenance. In the current database we only have information on movies for the year 2006. 
-- Now we have received the film catalog for 2020 as well. For this new data we will create another table and bulk insert all the data there. 
-- Code to create a new table has been provided below.

use sakila;

drop table if exists films_2020;

CREATE TABLE `films_2020` (
  `film_id` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `title` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `description` text,
  `release_year` year(4) DEFAULT NULL,
  `language_id` tinyint(3) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `original_language_id` tinyint(3) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,
  `rental_duration` int(6),
  `rental_rate` decimal(4,2),
  `length` smallint(5) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,
  `replacement_cost` decimal(5,2) DEFAULT NULL,
  `rating` enum('G','PG','PG-13','R','NC-17') DEFAULT NULL,

-- We have just one item for each film, and all will be placed in the new table. 
-- For 2020, the rental duration will be 3 days, with an offer price of 2.99â‚¬ and a replacement cost of 8.99â‚¬ (these are all fixed values for all movies for this year). 
-- The catalog is in a CSV file named films_2020.csv that can be found at files_for_lab folder.

-- instructions:
	-- Add the new films to the database.
	-- Update information on rental_duration, rental_rate, and replacement_cost.

-- 1 In the table actor, which are the actors whose last names are not repeated?
select * from actor;
select last_name, count(last_name) as sum_last_name from actor
group by last_name
having count(last_name) = 1;

-- 2 Which last names appear more than once? We would use the same logic as in the previous question but this time we want to include the last names of the actors where the last name was present more than once
select last_name, count(last_name) as sum_last_name from actor
group by last_name
having count(last_name) > 1
order by sum_last_name;

-- 3 Using the rental table, find out how many rentals were processed by each employee.
select * from rental;
select staff_id, count(staff_id) as rentals_staff from rental
group by staff_id;

-- 4 Using the film table, find out how many films were released each year.
select release_year, count(film_id) as nr_of_films from film
group by release_year
order by release_year asc;

-- 5 Using the film table, find out for each rating how many films were there.
select rating, count(film_id) as nr_of_films from film
group by rating
order by rating desc;

-- 6 What is the mean length of the film for each rating type. Round off the average lengths to two decimal places
select rating, count(film_id) as nr_of_films, round(avg(length), 2) as average_length from film
group by rating
order by rating desc;

-- 7 Which kind of movies (rating) have a mean duration of more than two hours?
select rating, count(film_id) as nr_of_films, round(avg(length), 2) as average_length from film
group by rating
having average_length > 120
order by rating desc;
